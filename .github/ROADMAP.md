# 🗺️ LINEA ROADMAP 🗺️

This roadmap should give direction on what to expect in the next few days, weeks as we continue to build together with the community.

Goal status:  
[ ✅ ] = achieved  
[ ❌ ] = not achieved  
[ ⛳ ] = planned

_Please note that this is not the final roadmap and what you see can be updated down the road, so check back regularly for any future updates._

## 🗿**Q4 2024**

[ ✅ ] **- THE IDEA WAS BORN**

> I was tired of using outdated UIs of traditional FTP clients like Cyberduck and Filezilla to update my savefiles for my 3DS games. I wanted to create a modern, visually appealing FTP client that could also synchronize my savefiles across devices, making it easier to play the same games on multiple platforms.

**[ ✅ ] - MARKET ANALYSIS**

> Once the idea was born, we looked for competitors to see if there was a viable market. We found a few and analyzed and grouped them according to two parameters: all-in-one and cross-platform. We got:
>
> - FileZilla ([https://filezilla-project.org/](https://filezilla-project.org/ 'https://filezilla-project.org/'))
> - CyberDuck ([https://cyberduck.io/](https://cyberduck.io/ 'https://cyberduck.io/'))
> - Termius ([https://termius.com/](https://termius.com/ 'https://termius.com/'))
>
> **Here is why Linea is better:**
>
> - **It's lightweight**: Linea runs on Tauri, which outperforms other stacks like Electron in terms of security and
>   performance.
> - **It's open source**: We strongly believe that in 21st century a software like this should be free

**[ ✅ ] - SOFTWARE STACK**

> When it comes to building a desktop application, developers face a dilemma: traditional Electron-based apps are heavy and slow, while native apps are hard to maintain and update. That's why we chose Tauri, a framework that allows us to build fast, secure, and easy-to-maintain desktop applications with web technologies. With Tauri, we can provide users with a modern, visually appealing interface and great performance without compromising.

**[ ✅ ] - LAUNCH THE PROJECT**

> We created a Github repository to grow up a community and a relationship between users and developers. Our goal is to not stop users' ideas with some feedbacks, but we want them to contribute directly to the project to grow blazingly fast. We also want to create a Discord server to give users a place to chat and give us feedback in real time.

## **Q1 2025**

**[ ⛳ ] - WORKING LOCAL FTP CLIENT**

> Let's start with basic functionality. The user must have the ability to:
>
> - Connect to any FTP server
> - Upload and download files
> - Create, rename and delete directories
