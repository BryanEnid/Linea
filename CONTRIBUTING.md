# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to this project! To make the process smooth and organized, please follow the guidelines below.

## Branching Strategy

We use a simple and clean branching strategy to keep our codebase organized and stable:

- **`main`**: This branch contains the latest stable, production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/<name>`)**:
  - For each new feature or bug fix, create a branch off `main`.
  - Use the naming convention `feature/<feature-name>`.
  - Example: `feature/add-dark-mode`.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Creating a Feature Branch

- Start by creating a new branch from `main`:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
  ```

- Make your changes, write tests, and commit them:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add feature description here"
  ```

### 2. Creating a Pull Request (PR)

- Push your branch to the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<feature-name>
  ```

- Open a pull request from your feature branch into `main`.

- Before merging:
  - Ensure all tests pass (automated via GitHub Actions).
  - Your code should have been reviewed and approved by at least one collaborator.

### 3. Merging Changes

- After your PR is approved:
  - Use GitHubâ€™s **Squash and Merge** option to combine your commits into a single commit.
  - Ensure the commit message is clear and concise (GitHub will use your PR title as the commit message by default).

### 4. Releasing

- When `main` is ready for release:

  - Tag the release commit with the version:
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

- GitHub Actions will automatically handle building and packaging the desktop app for distribution.
